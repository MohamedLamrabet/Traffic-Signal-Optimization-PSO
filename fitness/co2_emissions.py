To optimize CO2 emissions in the same code, you would need to modify the fitness function to include
a term that takes into account the emissions produced by the vehicles in the system.

One way to do this would be to use the vehicle emissions model developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
 which calculates the emissions of different pollutants based on the vehicle type, speed, and acceleration.
 You could use this model to estimate the total CO2 emissions produced by the vehicles in the system,
 and add a term to the fitness function that penalizes high emissions.

Objective 3: Minimize CO2 emissions
The CO2 emissions is the sum of the emissions at each intersection. The CO2 emissions at each intersection can be calculated using the following formula:
co2_emissions = ((q * EF * l) / 3600) * (1 / mpg) * (1 / GWP)
where:

q: traffic flow rate (vehicles per hour)
EF: CO2 emission factor (pounds per gallon)
l: effective green time (seconds)
mpg: average fuel economy (miles per gallon)
GWP: global warming potential (CO2-equivalent per pound)

Python code:

    cycle_lengths = [x[0], x[1], x[2]]
    green_times = [x[3], x[4], x[5]]
    emissions = [calculate_emissions(cycle_lengths[i], green_times[i]) for i in range(3)]
    total_emissions = sum(emissions)

    return total_emissions

"""
Note that the implementation assumes that the traffic flow rate, CO2 emission factor, average fuel economy, 
and global warming potential are already known and can be calculated for each intersection. 
In practice, these values may need to be estimated based on real-world data.
