"""
Travel time minimization for adaptive traffic systems is a common objective function used in traffic optimization.
 The objective is to minimize the average travel time for all vehicles in the network. It can be defined mathematically as:

f(x) = 1/N * sum_i=1^N (T_i)

where f(x) is the objective function, N is the total number of vehicles in the network, and T_i is the travel time for the i-th vehicle.
 The travel time for each vehicle can be calculated as the difference between the time the vehicle
enters the network and the time it reaches its destination.

The goal of optimizing this objective function is to reduce the overall congestion in the network and improve the travel experience for all users.
 Adaptive traffic systems can achieve this by adjusting traffic signal timings and other parameters in real-time based on traffic conditions, weather, and other factors.

Here's an example code for implementing Travel time with PSO optimization:
"""


import numpy as np
from pyswarm import pso

# Define the calculate_travel_time function
def calculate_travel_time(cycle_lengths, green_times):
    # Calculate the travel time for each vehicle in the network
    travel_times = []
    for i in range(N):
        # Calculate the time the vehicle enters the network
        entry_time = np.random.uniform(0, max_cycle_length - cycle_lengths[i])
        # Calculate the time the vehicle reaches its destination
        travel_time = entry_time + green_times[i]
        # Append the travel time to the list
        travel_times.append(travel_time)
    # Calculate the total travel time for all vehicles
    total_travel_time = sum(travel_times)
    # Return the total travel time
    return total_travel_time

# Define the objective function
def objective(x):
    # Calculate the total travel time for the given cycle lengths and green times
    cycle_lengths = x[:N]
    green_times = x[N:]
    total_travel_time = calculate_travel_time(cycle_lengths, green_times)
    # Minimize the total travel time
    return total_travel_time / N

# Define the number of vehicles in the network
N = 50

# Define the maximum cycle length
max_cycle_length = 120

# Define the optimization bounds
lb = np.zeros(2 * N)
ub = np.full(2 * N, max_cycle_length)

# Define the optimization options
options = {'maxiter': 100, 'disp': True}

# Run the optimization algorithm
xopt, fopt = pso(objective, lb, ub, maxiter=100, debug=True)

# Print the optimized results
print('Optimized cycle lengths:', xopt[:N])
print('Optimized green times:', xopt[N:])
print('Total travel time:', fopt)

"""

In this code, we first define the calculate_travel_time function, which takes in the cycle lengths and green times as inputs and returns the total travel time
 for all vehicles in the network. This function randomly generates entry times for each vehicle and calculates the travel time as the sum 
of the entry time and the green time.

We then define the objective function, which takes in a vector x of length 2N, where the first N elements are the cycle lengths and 
the last N elements are the green times. The function calculates the total travel time for the given cycle lengths and green times
 using the calculate_travel_time function and returns the average travel time per vehicle.

We define the number of vehicles in the network N and the maximum cycle length max_cycle_length. We set the lower bound
 for all cycle lengths and green times to 0 and the upper bound to max_cycle_length.

We define the optimization options and run the PSO algorithm using the pso function from the pyswarm library. 
The pso function takes the objective function, the lower and upper bounds, and the options as input arguments and 
returns the optimized cycle lengths and green times xopt and the minimum travel time fopt.

Finally, we print the optimized results to the console.
