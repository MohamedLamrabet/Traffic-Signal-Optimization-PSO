Objective 1: Minimize total delay
The total delay is the sum of the delays at each intersection. The delay at each intersection can be calculated using the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 equation:
delay = ((q^3 * k * L) / (s * v)) * (1 - ((q * l) / (s * v)))
where:

q: traffic flow rate (vehicles per hour)
k: saturation flow rate (vehicles per hour per lane)
L: lane group length (feet)
s: speed (feet per second)
v: free-flow speed (feet per second)
l: effective green time (seconds)

Here's an example code using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize the first objective function in the TrafficOptimization problem:
"""
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from pyswarm import pso

# Define the objective function to be optimized
def obj_func(x):
    cycle_lengths = [x[0], x[1], x[2]]
    green_times = [x[3], x[4], x[5]]

    # Calculate total delay
    delays = []
    for i in range(3):
        delay = calculate_delay(cycle_lengths[i], green_times[i], i)
        delays.append(delay)
    total_delay = sum(delays)

    return total_delay

# Define the bounds for the variables
lb = np.array([10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10])
ub = np.array([90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90])

# Define the function to calculate delay for a given cycle length and green time at an intersection
def calculate_delay(cycle_length, green_time, intersection):
    # Calculate delay using HCM 2000 equation
    s = 1900 # saturation flow rate (vehicles per hour)
    v = 1600 # volume (vehicles per hour)
    a = 4.0 # acceleration rate (feet per second squared)
    d = 100 # distance between stop line and upstream detector (feet)
    g = green_time # green time (seconds)
    
    delay = (1.5 * s * v * (1 + (v / a)) * (1 - (d / s))) / (g * (1 - (v / g))) # calculate delay using HCM 2000 equation
    return delay

# Run the optimization using PSO
xopt, fopt = pso(obj_func, lb, ub)

# Print the optimal solution
print("Optimal solution: ", xopt)
print("Optimal delay: ", fopt)

"""
In this code, we define the objective function obj_func to be optimized, which takes a vector x of 6 variables (3 cycle lengths and 3 green times) 
as input and returns the total delay. We also define the bounds for the variables using lb and ub, which are the same as in the previous example.

We then define the function calculate_delay to calculate delay for a given cycle length and green time at an intersection. 
This function is the same as in the previous example.

Finally, we use the PSO function pso from the pyswarm library to optimize the objective function. 
The pso function takes the objective function, lower bounds, and upper bounds as input and returns the optimal solution xopt and optimal delay fopt.
 We print these values at the end of the code.
